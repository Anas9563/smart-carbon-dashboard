# Smart Carbon Dashboard

This project implements an interactive web-based dashboard for the exploratory analysis of CO₂ and greenhouse gas emissions data.

The system supports:
- Interactive visualisation of historical emissions data
- Comparative analysis across regions and sectors
- Exploratory, short-term predictive trend visualisation

Data sources include publicly available datasets from Our World in Data and the Global Carbon Budget.

This repository contains the source code, data processing scripts, and documentation for the project.
